**terraform-branch-deploy** brings the power of [IssueOps](https://issue-ops.github.io/docs/) to your infrastructure. Comment `.plan` or `.apply` on any pull request to deploy Terraform changes **before** merging—making your main branch always stable and deployable.

## ✨ Why You'll Love It

- **🗨️ ChatOps Magic**: Deploy infrastructure with simple PR comments like `.plan` and `.apply`
- **🛡️ Safety First**: Test changes in real environments before they hit your main branch
- **🌍 Multi-Environment**: Deploy to dev, staging, prod with environment-specific configurations
- **🔒 Smart Locking**: Prevent conflicting deployments with automatic environment locks
- **🏢 Enterprise Ready**: Full GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) compatibility with automated releases
- **⚙️ Highly Configurable**: Fine-tune everything with a simple YAML configuration file

## 🎮 Quick Commands

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `.plan` | Preview changes for the default environment |
| `.apply` | Deploy changes for the default environment |
| `.plan to staging` | Preview changes for staging environment |
| `.apply to staging` | Deploy changes to staging environment |
| `.apply main to prod` | Rollback prod to main branch (emergency) |
| `.lock` | Lock an environment to prevent deployments |
| `.unlock` | Release environment lock |
| `.wcid` | "Where Can I Deploy?" - show lock status |

> **Pro tip**: Add extra Terraform arguments with a pipe: `.plan | -var=debug=true`

## 🚀 Getting Started

Ready to deploy infrastructure like a pro? Here's your 3-step setup:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have:
- A GitHub repository with Terraform configuration files
- Appropriate cloud provider credentials (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)
- GitHub repository permissions for Actions and Deployments

### Step 1: Create Your Workflow

Create `.github/workflows/terraform-deploy.yml` in your repository:

```yaml
name: "Terraform Branch Deploy"

on:
  issue_comment:
    types: [created]

permissions:
  pull-requests: write
  deployments: write
  contents: write
  checks: read
  statuses: read

jobs:
  terraform_deployment:
    if: ${{ github.event.issue.pull_request }}
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      # Add your cloud authentication here (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.)

      - name: terraform-branch-deploy
        uses: scarowar/terraform-branch-deploy@v0.1.0
        with:
          github-token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

### Step 2: Configure Your Environments

Create `.tf-branch-deploy.yml` in your repository root:

```yaml
# yaml-language-server: $schema=./tf-branch-deploy.schema.json

default-environment: dev

production-environments:
  - prod

defaults:
  var-files:
    paths:
      - common.tfvars
  plan-args:
    args:
      - "-compact-warnings"

environments:
  dev:
    working-directory: ./terraform/dev
    var-files:
      paths:
        - ./terraform/dev/dev.tfvars

  prod:
    working-directory: ./terraform/prod
    var-files:
      inherit: false  # Don't inherit common.tfvars
      paths:
        - ./terraform/prod/prod.tfvars
        - ./terraform/prod/secrets.tfvars
```

### Step 3: Deploy

Comment on any pull request to deploy your changes:

- **`.plan`** → Preview what changes will be made
- **`.apply`** → Deploy the changes
- **`.apply main to prod`** → Emergency rollback to main branch


## 🧠 How It Works

terraform-branch-deploy follows the **[branch deployment](https://github.com/marketplace/actions/branch-deploy#about-)** pattern - a battle-tested approach that keeps your main branch stable:

### The Branch Deployment Philosophy

- **🎯 Main is Sacred**: Your main branch is always stable and deployable
- **🔬 Test Before Merge**: Deploy and test infrastructure changes from feature branches
- **🚨 Easy Rollbacks**: Emergency? Deploy main branch to rollback instantly
- **🔍 Preview Everything**: See exactly what will change before applying

### Under the Hood

1. **Comment**: You comment `.plan` on a PR
2. **Validate**: Action validates Terraform syntax and formatting
3. **Plan**: Terraform plan runs and posts results as PR comment
4. **Apply**: Comment `.apply` to deploy the planned changes
5. **Track**: GitHub deployment status tracks your infrastructure state

This approach eliminates the dreaded "merge → deploy → break → scramble" cycle that plagues traditional workflows.

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Action Inputs

| Input | Description | Default | Example |
|-------|-------------|---------|---------|
| `github-token` | GitHub token with required permissions | - | `${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}` |
| `terraform-version` | Terraform CLI version to use | `latest` | `1.7.5` |
| `working-directory` | Default path to Terraform files | `.` | `infrastructure/` |
| `noop-trigger` | Command for plan operations | `.plan` | `.preview` |
| `trigger` | Command for apply operations | `.apply` | `.deploy` |
| `stable_branch` | Branch for rollback operations | `main` | `master` |
| `skip` | Extract environment info and exit early | `false` | `true` |
| `admins` | Comma-separated list of admin users/teams | `false` | `monalisa,octocat,my-org/my-team` |
| `admins_pat` | Personal access token for org team access | `false` | `${{ secrets.ADMIN_PAT }}` |

### Enterprise Support

🏢 **GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) Users**: We automatically create GHES-compatible releases with every new version. Look for releases tagged with `-ghes` suffix (e.g., `v0.1.0-ghes`) which use compatible action versions.

## 💡 Advanced Features

### Environment Inheritance
Configure defaults once, override per environment:

```yaml
defaults:
  plan-args:
    args: ["-compact-warnings"]

environments:
  prod:
    plan-args:
      inherit: false  # Don't inherit defaults
      args: ["-parallelism=30"]
```

### Dynamic Arguments
Pass extra Terraform arguments via comments:

```bash
.plan | -var=debug=true -target=module.api
.apply | -auto-approve=false
```

### Smart Locking
Prevent deployment conflicts:

```bash
.lock prod --reason "Maintenance window"
.unlock prod
.wcid  # "Where Can I Deploy?" - shows all locks
```
