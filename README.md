## üìù Overview

Terraform Branch Deploy extends [branch-deploy](https://github.com/github/branch-deploy) with first-class support for Terraform infrastructure automation.

## ‚≠ê Key Features

- **PR-driven automation**: Trigger `plan` and `apply` by commenting on pull requests.
- **Environment targeting**: Define environments (dev, staging, prod, etc.) in `.tf-branch-deploy.yml` with per-environment config, var files, and working directories.
- **Safe deployments**: Preview every change with a Terraform plan before apply, and support instant rollbacks to a stable branch.
- **Environment locking**: Prevent concurrent or conflicting deployments with automatic and manual environment locks.
- **Custom arguments**: Pass extra Terraform CLI arguments from PR comments and fine-tune behavior per environment or globally via `.tf-branch-deploy.yml`.
- **Enterprise ready**: Works with GitHub Enterprise Server (GHES) and public GitHub, with automated GHES release tagging.
- **Workflow integration**: Use the `skip` input to extract environment context for advanced, multi-step workflows without running Terraform operations.
