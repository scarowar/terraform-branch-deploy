## Reporting a Vulnerability


To report a security vulnerability, please open a [private security advisory](https://github.com/scarowar/terraform-branch-deploy/security/advisories).


We will review your report and provide a status update as soon as possible. If the vulnerability is accepted, we will work with you on a coordinated disclosure timeline. If declined, we will explain why.

Please do not disclose security issues publicly until they have been reviewed and addressed.
